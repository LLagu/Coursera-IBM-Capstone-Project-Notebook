Introduction/Business Problem

Milan is the economy center of Italy and a beautiful multicultural city. Food, as in the rest of the country, has a very important traditional aspect, but in Milan there's also space for innovation and creativity.

So let's say that you want to open a food shop in Milan, but as an entrepreneur you want to know who represents competition and how you can make your activity stand from the crowd. In this notebook I’ll analyze each area and identify the most common type of food shops for each one of them. Furthermore, I’ll analyze the local ethnic groups to better understand which other cultures (other than the predominant Italian one) are present in every given area.

There are various way to subdivide Milan, but the best one in my opinion is through the NIL areas. NIL stands for “Nuclei di Identità Locale”, which means “Local Identity Nucleuses” . Quoting from the Milan municipality website, a NIL expresses the territorial phenomena representative of the present local dynamism.

It’s a great subdivision of the city if we want key information in order to give our food shop a little twist to make clients notice us and maybe appeal the local ethnic groups.


ADDRESSING THE PROJECT & FUTURE ANALYSIS

While this little project is nothing more than an academic exercise (COURSERA IBM DATA SCIENCE CAPSTONE PROJECT),and there are many assumpions I adopted in order to make my life easier ,I'm planning to greatly expand it.

Some of the ideas I have:

- Give more information other than just nationalities such as age, sex distribution, number of families, presence of schools etc.
- Give also the least present food shop types for each NIL, making it easier to go for the last approach mentioned in the conclusions section
